    "One popular use of the k-means algorithm is in image compression (see Murphy 11.4.2.6).  In general images are encoded as a grid of 3 8-bit integers (the red, green, and blue bands, each ranging from 0-255).  To use K-means to compress an image, K-means clustering is performed on the array of pixel values to obtain the K colors most that in some sense contain the most information.  The compressed image is generated by replacing each pixel value with the index of the nearest K-means cluster center.  When it is time to display the image, each pixel value is reconstructed by looking up the RGB value corresponding to its index.  This process is referred to as *Image quantization*.\n",

    "Import an image of your choosing, and apply K-means based image quantization to it.  You can write the code for K-means yourself, adapt the code from the lecture, or you can use the scikit-learn implementation, which can be imported with the following command:"
